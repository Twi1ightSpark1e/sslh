sslh -- A ssl/ssh multiplexer
=============================

`sslh` accepts connections on specified ports, and forwards
them further based on tests performed on the first data
packet sent by the remote client.

Probes for HTTP, TLS/SSL (including SNI and ALPN), SSH,
OpenVPN, tinc, XMPP, SOCKS5, are implemented, and any other
protocol that can be tested using a regular expression, can
be recognised. A typical use case is to allow serving
several services on port 443 (e.g. to connect to SSH from
inside a corporate firewall, which almost never block port
443) while still serving HTTPS on that port. 

Hence `sslh` acts as a protocol demultiplexer, or a
switchboard. With the SNI and ALPN probe, it makes a good
front-end to a virtual host farm hosted behind a single IP
address.

`sslh` has the bells and whistles expected from a mature
daemon: privilege and capabilities dropping, inetd support,
systemd support, transparent proxying,
chroot, logging, IPv4 and IPv6, a fork-based and a
select-based model, and more.

### Twi1ightSpark1e's fork

This fork brings in partial MTProto proxy support. To implement
it, I used details given [here](https://habr.com/ru/post/461171/)
(russian source), and some source code from
[alexbers/mtprotoproxy](https://github.com/alexbers/mtprotoproxy).

**!Currently, FakeTLS mode supported only!**


Install
